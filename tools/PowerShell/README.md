# `check-abnf.ps1` for Windows PowerShell

This script compiles the three [OData ABNF files](../../abnf) into a parser using the Java APG fork from https://github.com/ralfhandl/apg-java.

It then executes all tests in the three testcase XML files using the generated parser and the ABNF test tools from https://github.com/SAP/abnf-test-tool.


 ## Installation
 
 You need a [Java SE JDK](http://jdk.java.net) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed and in the PATH. 
 
 Start PowerShell, clone this repository and run the `check-abnf.ps1` script:

```posh
git clone https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-abnf.git
cd odata-abnf/tools/PowerShell
./check-abnf.ps1
```
 
The script checks if the required `apg.jar` and `abnf-test-tool.jar` files exist. If not, it will clone the repositories
- https://github.com/ralfhandl/apg-java and
- https://github.com/SAP/abnf-test-tool

next to this project and build the jar files.


## Usage

In the `PowerShell` folder execute

```posh
./check-abnf.ps1
```

This should result in something like

```
Running test cases from ../../abnf/odata-abnf-testcases.xml
All 732 test cases passed

Running test cases from ../../abnf/odata-aggregation-testcases.xml
All 89 test cases passed

Running test cases from ../../abnf/odata-temporal-testcases.xml
All 8 test cases passed

477 of 477 rules covered (100%)
```

If called with the `-watch` option the script also watches the `abnf` directory for changes, recompiles the parser if necessary, and reruns the tests:

```posh
./check-abnf.ps1 -watch
```

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the script.

In Visual Studio Code you can run the script in the background via **Run Task...** from the global **Terminal** menu and selecting `Check ABNF & watch`.
