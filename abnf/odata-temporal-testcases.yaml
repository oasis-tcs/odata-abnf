#  Abstract:
#  This specification defines how to represent and interact with temporal data
#  using the Open Data Protocol (OData).
#
#  Overview:
#  This document contains positive and negative test cases for the
#  OData Temporal ABNF Construction Rules Version 4.0.
#  Positive test cases consist of the rule to test, the input string to parse,
#  and a description of the test case.
#  Negative test cases in addition state the character position at which the
#  invalid portion of input text starts, 0 meaning the whole input string.
#
#  These test cases can be automatically executed with the ABNF test tool
#  available at https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-abnf/tree/main/lib.
#  This tool is neither required for interpreting the test cases, nor is it
#  part of the OData work product.
