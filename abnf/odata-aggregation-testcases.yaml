# Additional artifacts:
#   This test case document is one component of a Work Product which consists of:
#   - OData Extension for Data Aggregation Version 4.0
#   - OData Aggregation Vocabulary
#   - OData Aggregation ABNF Construction Rules Version 4.0
#   - OData Aggregation ABNF Test Cases (this document)
#
# Related work:
#   This specification is related to:
#   - OData Version 4.01 Part 1: Protocol
#   - OData Version 4.01 Part 2: URL Conventions
#   - OData ABNF Construction Rules Version 4.01
#   - OData ABNF Test Cases Version 4.01
#   - OData Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL) JSON Representation Version 4.01
#   - OData Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL) XML Representation Version 4.01
#   - OData JSON Format Version 4.01
#   This specification replaces or supersedes:
#   - None
#
# Declared XML namespaces:
#   - None
#
# Abstract:
#   This specification adds basic grouping and aggregation functionality (such as
#   sum, min, and max) to the Open Data Protocol (OData) without changing any
#   of the base principles of OData.
#
#
# Overview:
#   This document contains positive and negative test cases for the
#   OData Aggregation ABNF Construction Rules Version 4.0.
#   Positive test cases consist of the rule to test, the input string to parse,
#   and a description of the test case.
#   Negative test cases in addition state the character position at which the
#   invalid portion of input text starts, 0 meaning the whole input string.
#
#   These test cases can be automatically executed with the ABNF test tool
#   available at https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-abnf/tree/main/lib.
#   This tool is neither required for interpreting the test cases, nor is it
#   part of the OData work product.
