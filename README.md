<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this repository is to develop and maintain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">ABNF-based</a> grammars for OData Uniform Resource Identifiers, request and response headers, and literal data values in request and response bodies. Each grammar is accompanied by a set of positive and negative test cases that serve as examples for what is intended and not intended, and that can also be used to automatically test the grammars.</p>

<h3>Further Description of this Repository</h3>

The [`abnf` folder](abnf) contains three pairs of grammars and test cases:

- Core [grammar](abnf/odata-abnf-construction-rules.txt) and [test cases](abnf/odata-abnf-testcases.xml)
- Data Aggregation Extension [grammar](abnf/odata-aggregation-abnf.txt) and [test cases](abnf/odata-aggregation-testcases.xml)
- Temporal Data Extension [grammar](abnf/odata-temporal-abnf.txt) and [test cases](abnf/odata-temporal-testcases.xml)

The grammars of the two extensions are incremental and add new alternatives to "Core" rules as well as new rules used in the new alternatives.

The [`lib` folder](lib) contains tools for automatically testing the grammars.
